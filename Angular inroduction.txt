Angular is maintained by a dedicated team at google and it provides tools and APIs with comprehensive libraries to simplify the development workflow.

Features of Angular:
1. Keep our codebase organized with an opinionated component model and flexible dependency injection system
  . Angular components make it easy to split your code into well-encapsulated parts.
  . The versatile dependency injection helps you keep your code modular, loosely-coupled, and testable

2. Get fast state updates with fine-grained reactivity based on signals
  . Optimized compile time
  . Virtual DOM update

3. Meet your performance targets with SSR, SSG, hydration and next-generation deferred loading
  . Supports both Server side rendering(SSR) and Static side generation(SSG)
  . Full DOM hydration
  . @defer blocks in templates make it simple to declaratively divide your templates into lazy loadable parts

4. Angular's first-party modules for forms, routing and more
  . Angular's in build routing process
  . Angular's in build form modules to get the data from client
